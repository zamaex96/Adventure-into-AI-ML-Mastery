## Phase 1️⃣: Laying the Math Groundwork (20-25 hours)  
**Playlist:** *Foundations for ML* - [Click here to kick things off](https://lnkd.in/gKz-eybU)  
**Why Start Here?**  
Bruh, this is where you build your superhero origin story! We’re talking the core stuff—Linear Algebra (think matrix magic), Probability (odds are, you’ll love it), Statistics (data’s BFF), Calculus (slopes and curves, baby), Optimization (finding the sweet spot), and some Programming fundamentals to flex those coding muscles. No skipping this—it’s the bedrock of everything ML!  
**How Long?**  
Chill with 2-3 hours a week for 8 weeks. That’s like a Netflix binge but way more productive. By the end, you’ll be tossing around math terms like a boss.

## Phase 2️⃣: Machine Learning Vibes (60-65 hours)  
**Playlist 1:** *ML Teach by Doing* - [Get hands-on here](https://lnkd.in/gn2dEcE2)  
**Why It’s Fire?**  
This is where the rubber meets the road, fam! You’ll dive into practical, project-based ML workflows—think of it as cooking up some ML recipes from scratch. No boring theory dumps—just real-deal learning by doing.  
**Commitment:**  
4 hours a week for 10 weeks. That’s a couple of coffee runs’ worth of time to unlock the ML sauce.  

**Playlist 2:** *Decision Trees from Scratch* - [Branch out here](https://lnkd.in/g3cmj2BR)  
**Why It Slaps?**  
Decision trees are the unsung heroes of ML—like the roots holding up a massive tree of models. You’ll master these bad boys and see why they’re clutch for so much ML goodness.  
**Commitment:**  
4 hours a week for 5 weeks. Easy peasy—you’ll be branching out like a pro in no time.

## Phase 4️⃣: Next-Level ML Shenanigans (40-45 hours)  
**Playlist 1:** *Graph Neural Networks - Theory, Applications, and Research* - [Connect the dots here](https://lnkd.in/g3RCPS8e)  
**Why It’s Lit?**  
Graphs are blowing up in ML—think social networks, biology, and beyond. This is your ticket to the cool kids’ table of cutting-edge tech. You’ll be flexing graph-based ML skills like a futuristic ninja.  
**Commitment:**  
3 hours a week for 8 weeks. Low-key effort, high-key rewards.  

**Playlist 2:** *ML Project-Based Course: Explainable AI* - [Make it make sense here](https://lnkd.in/gNEx3ghr)  
**Why XAI is the Move?**  
Explainable AI (XAI) is all about making ML less of a mysterious black box and more of a “here’s why it works” vibe. You’ll crank out projects that don’t just work—they *explain* themselves. Bonus? You might even drop your first research paper. Yup, you’re that guy/gal now!  
**Commitment:**  
3 hours a week for 5 weeks. By the end, you’ll be spitting knowledge *and* credibility.
